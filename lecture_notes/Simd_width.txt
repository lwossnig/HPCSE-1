Q: How can i find the simd width of my local machine and the Flop/cycle ?

A:
It is not easy to find unless you know what to look for.
You can read it of your cpuinfo output.
You can usually determine it by the flags/features.
If x86 CPUs have "sse", "sse2",...,"sse4_2" or other sse flags it
supports at least 128bit SIMD width.
If your flags also lists "avx" the CPU supports 256bit SIMD width.
The next generation of Intel will have "avx512", which are 512bit SIMD
width.

In your case:

Your CPU supports AVX, hence the SIMD width is 256bit.

The FLOP/cycle thing is even more cumbersome, because CPUs have become
really complicated nowadays. Usually you find some information on the
"instruction throughput" in the manuals of the CPUs(e.g.[1]) which
specifies how many cycles (sometimes fractions of a cycle) you have to
wait until the CPU can perform the same operation again.
This number varies on the particular instruction. You could use the add
operation as a reference for the FLOP/cycle.

However, modern CPUs are "superscalar" and may perform different
operations (eg. add and multiply) at the same time. If you want to get
the real number you really have to dive deep into the manual...
